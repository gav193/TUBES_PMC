## Premise
A clinic in City X is making a patient-listing system to see whether they're coming in to do a medical diagnosis and/or to get treatment. Presently, clinic X notes down the patient record manually in a book (within the attachment file `DataPMC20232024.xls`). Based on that, you (as a developer) is tasked to help them make an application to list the patients in clinic X with these features:
1. Adding, modifying, deleting, and searching the data of patients that come to clinic X
2. Adding, modifying, deleting, and searching the history of arrival, diagnosis, and treatment on patients that come to clinic X
3. Providing patient information and medical history in clinic X to the medical workers
4. Retrieving a report information on monthly and annual income along with the average annual income of clinic X
5. Retrieving information to the medical workers about patients who need to come back for control
